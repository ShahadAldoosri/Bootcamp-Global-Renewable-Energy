# Global Renewable Energy Analysis


## Project Overview
The global renewable energy landscape is rapidly evolving, driven by the need for sustainable energy solutions and the reduction of carbon emissions. This analysis focuses on examining renewable energy data from various sources to uncover trends, identify key insights, and support strategic decision-making in the energy sector.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze a comprehensive dataset related to global renewable energy production and consumption. By leveraging Python for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization, I aim to answer critical questions about renewable energy trends, types of energy sources, and their geographical distribution.

## Data Cleaning Process

 #### Data Collection: Gathered data from multiple sources, including international energy agencies and renewable energy databases.
 ## Data Cleaning with Python: Utilized Python, specifically libraries like Pandas, to:
 #### -Remove duplicates and irrelevant entries.
 #### -Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
 #### -Standardize data formats (e.g., date and numerical formats) for consistency.
 #### -Create new calculated fields as necessary (e.g., total renewable energy production).
 #### -Data Analysis and Visualization

After cleaning the dataset, I employed Power BI to create interactive visualizations that addressed the following key questions:


## Analysis of Renewable Energy Visuals

#### -How is electricity capacity distributed across different regions?
#### Visualization: The map illustrates the electricity capacity (in MW) of renewable energy across various geographical areas.
#### Insights: This visual helps identify regional leaders in renewable energy capacity and areas where further investments could be beneficial.
#### -What trends are evident in electricity generation over the years?
#### Visualization: The bar chart displays electricity generation (in GWh) segmented by technology from 2018 to 2020.
#### Insights: Analyzing this chart reveals which renewable technologies (e.g., solar, wind, hydro) are increasing or decreasing in generation, reflecting shifts in energy production strategies.
#### -Which countries are leading in renewable energy investments?
#### Visualization: This section ranks the top five countries by the amount of investments (in millions) in renewable energy.
#### Insights: It highlights key players in the renewable energy market, providing insight into where financial resources are being allocated.
#### -What is the distribution of renewable energy technologies in generation?
#### Visualization: The line chart represents the renewable energy distribution over time, showing different technology contributions to total generation.
#### Insights: This visual indicates which renewable technologies are gaining popularity and how their contributions to the energy mix are evolving.
#### -How are jobs distributed across different renewable energy sectors?
#### Visualization: This chart compares job creation across various energy sectors (e.g., wind, solar, hydro).
#### Insights: Understanding job trends can inform policy and investment decisions, highlighting which sectors are providing the most employment opportunities.


## Conclusion
These visuals collectively offer a comprehensive overview of the current state and trends in renewable energy. They inform stakeholders about capacity, generation technologies, investment priorities, and job market developments within the renewable sector.
